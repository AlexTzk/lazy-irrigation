# Lazy-irrigation
Automated irrigation system with Arduino

* uses capacitive moisture sensors and sends a signal to a relay on the board to trigger a pump for watering if moisture levels drop below 20%

## To-do
* Record over-time moisture values in a Database
* Record triggers for the relays in a Database alongside with their duration
* Graph the aforementioned values in a pretty way with a 3rd party such as Grafana
